# Energy HPC 2023 workshop - From Zero to Devtio

Workshop takes place Thursday, 2nd March 2023 (09:00 â€“ 12:00 CST): 

* Presented by: Dr. Rhodri Nelson (Imperial College London),
                Ed Caunt (Imperial College London), Zoe Leibowitz (Imperial College London)
* Conference website: https://energyhpc.rice.edu/

## Workshop prerequisites:
* Basic Python programming knowledge
* Basic knowledge of finite differences
* A laptop computer (optional)

[Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) is a domain specific language (DSL) and compiler for finite difference schemes. This workshop will provide attendees with an introduction to the core elements of the Devito DSL. A breakdown of the agenda is as follows:
* Introduction to the DSL - Expressing PDEs in Devito
* Introduction to Devito operators
* Building wave-propagators
* Full waveform inversion with Devito

For attendees who would like a more hands on experience during the workshop, it is recommended to make use of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). After navigating to the [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) website you will be presented with a dialogue box, click on the `GitHub` tab and under `Enter a GitHub URL or search by organisation or user` enter `devitocodes/Energy-HPC-2023`. You will then be able to load the notebooks for today's session. At the head of each notebook, create a new code cell, enter `!pip install devito` and then run this cell. You're then up and running. (A demonstration of using Colab to run the tutorial notebooks will be given at the start of the workshop).

Alternatively, if you wish to install Devito locally, see the installation instructions provided [here](https://www.devitoproject.org/devito/download.html).
